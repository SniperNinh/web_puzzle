                        solving the previous one. to get past a level you need to solve a few jigsaw puzzles, with
                        varying difficulty and time limits per level. solve some puzzles and find the flags!<br><br>some
                        notes - </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>brute force against this challenge's infrastructure isn't strictly forbidden, but it won't
                            help you. there is a 350ms rate limit on most API endpoints for good measure. if you DoS me
                            i will be sad.</li>
                        <li>everything you need for each level is provided to you. instead of a flag, level 4 unlocks a
                            challenge source code download that may or may not help you with level 5</li>
                        <li>the artwork i used for the puzzles is mostly sourced from artists on twitter. credits and a
                            source link are given for each of them</li>
                        <li>flags are formatted in all lowercase, prefixed with the challenge number they refer to</li>
                        <li>this is in misc instead of web for a reason :p</li>
                        <li>this challenge is mostly re-used with some modifications from the 2025 RITSEC CTF. during
                            that event, the levels beyond the trivial got zero solves, and the source code for the
                            challenge was not unlocked for any team.</li>
